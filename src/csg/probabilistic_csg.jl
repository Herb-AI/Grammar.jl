"""
Function for converting an `Expr` to a [`ContextSensitiveGrammar`](@ref) with probabilities.
If the expression is hardcoded, you should use the `@pcsgrammar` macro.
Only expressions in the correct format (see [`@pcsgrammar`](@ref)) can be converted.

### Example usage:
	
```@example
grammar = expr2pcsgrammar(
	begin
		0.5 : R = x
		0.3 : R = 1 | 2
		0.2 : R = R + R
	end
)
```
"""
function expr2pcsgrammar(ex::Expr)::ContextSensitiveGrammar
	cfg2csg(expr2pcfgrammar(ex))
end

"""
	@pcsgrammar

A macro for defining a probabilistic [`ContextSensitiveGrammar`](@ref). 

### Example usage:
```julia
grammar = @pcsgrammar begin
	0.5 : R = x
	0.3 : R = 1 | 2
	0.2 : R = R + R
end
```

### Syntax:

The syntax of rules is identical to the syntax used by [`@csgrammar`](@ref):

- Literals: Symbols that are already defined in Julia are considered literals, such as `1`, `2`, or `Ï€`.
  For example: `R = 1`.
- Variables: A variable is a symbol that is not a nonterminal symbol and not already defined in Julia.
  For example: `R = x`.
- Functions: Functions and infix operators that are defined in Julia or the `Main` module can be used 
  with the default evaluator. For example: `R = R + R`, `R = f(a, b)`.
- Combinations: Multiple rules can be defined on a single line in the grammar definition using the `|` symbol.
  For example: `R = 1 | 2 | 3`.
- Iterators: Another way to define multiple rules is by providing a Julia iterator after a `|` symbol.
  For example: `R = |(1:9)`.

Every rule is also prefixed with a probability.
Rules and probabilities are separated using the `:` symbol.
If multiple rules are defined on a single line, the probability is equally divided between the rules.
The sum of probabilities for all rules of a certain non-terminal symbol should be equal to 1. 
The probabilities are automatically scaled if this isn't the case.
